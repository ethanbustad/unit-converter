consider making ConversionTable static, to reduce conversion time after program starts

need to figure out converting back and forth b/t currencies -- checks for rate twice (every time?)

set currency timeout to very short, so you don't have to sit there forever if your internet is down

before regexing input, check for things like "fluid [a-z]" or "cubic [a-z]"
