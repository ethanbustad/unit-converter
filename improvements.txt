make a readme file for the repo
create a batch file to start it up
consider making ConversionTable static, to reduce conversion time after program starts


need to figure out converting back and forth b/t currencies -- checks for rate twice (every time?)
need to add in support for standard prefixes
need to add in support for complex conversions
	two options for more complex conversions:
		move forward with algorithm. fast startup, minimally slow delay on hard conversion call
		have the system spin up all possible combinations at launch... slower start, faster calls
	algorithm can assume only one path between "from" and "to", I think
set currency timeout to very short, so you don't have to sit there forever if your internet is down
